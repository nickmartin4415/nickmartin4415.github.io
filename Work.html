<h1> Work </h1>

<p>
I am a working man, I have been since my freshmen year of highschool.carried over into all other parts of my life and has done a great impact. 
When I was a freshmen in high school my older brother was a senior at the time. He created a landscaping business with himself and his friends called North Andover Handymen. They created 1,000 flyers and sent them all around town. They would do odd jobs which basically means anything a customer needed done with manual labor they would take care of it. On an average day they would be mowing lawns, painting fences, and trimming hedges. As a freshmen I got to work for my brother and it was a great experience because it was my first job. However when my brother graduated and went off to college the business was over.
 It wasn’t until late my sophomore year when I got my license that I decided to restart the business this time with myself and my friends. My brother gave me some customers he knew as a good start for me to grow the business. Before I knew it we had a new job almost every day varying from dumping brush to the nearby dump, all the way to painting basement ceilings. I loved this kind of work and didn’t mind doing the physical labor at all. I grew up doing this kind of work all the time around my house with my father who is a big believer in the “do it yourself” mindset. I worked consistently through the rest of my years in high school all the way up till my last summer in NA before I left for college.
