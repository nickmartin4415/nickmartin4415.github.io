<h1>Academics </h1>

<p>
, I attended a catholic elementary/middle school named Saint Michaels from nursery to the eighth grade. Going to the same school for about 12 years I made lifelong friends that I will never forget. Saint Michaels was a great experience that raised me to have proper manners and a great work ethic that I am ever so grateful for. After Saint Michaels I decided to attend the townâ€™s public high school, North Andover High school.At North Andover i was exposed to many different courses from chemistry to bussiness classes. It was in these bussiness classes where found a true interest in majoring in bussiness in college. From there me and my buddies joined DECA which is an international bussiness competetion that gives students a taste of the real life bussiness world. We did great, we created an app called "The Wave", follow us on twitter @TheWaveInc. We advanced to the states level but unfortunatly we did not advance to the national level of competetion. All in all acedemics is a huge part of my life and I plan on doing my best to give myself the best oppurtunites in the real world.
