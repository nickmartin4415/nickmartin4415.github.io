<h1> Sports </h1>

<p>
I played multiple sports in my youth ranging from basketball to snowboarding. This was was a great time in my life because I remember trying new sports and activites for the first time and it was so excting. Once I reached high school I found the three sports I liked the most and decided to continue on with them. Football, Basketball, and Lacrosse. I spent countless hours training for each in the summer and off time I had inbetween the sports seasons. After Freshmen year I decided to drop football for two reasons. One being that I did not enjoy the sport enough to endure the common injuries that occured on a day to day basis. The second reason was that being a three sport athlete in highschool was no joke! It took alot of time away from school work and free time. So  for the rest of high school I stuck strong with basketball and lacrosse. By my senoir year I was named a captain of the lacrosse team aswell as winning conference titles in both basketball and lacrosse. The freinds you make playing sports for four years together is like no other and I enjoied every minute of the grind that it took to win those titles.
