<p>
Let me say this loud and clear I LOVE FOOD! All and every kind of food, except for yogurt not a big fan of that.
Id have to say that my favorite foods are from the itailan food style. I can eat pasta dishes and pizza for days. Dont get me wrong I am no gluten, I have a certain level of apprecaition for food. I love to cook and serve food for others. Adding my own twist to dishes and seeing the reaction of those eating it is pricless to me.It is one day a dream of mine to open up a small resturant in my name. This will ideally be in my later years of life so I can have lots of time to think it through.
