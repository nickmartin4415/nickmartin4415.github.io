<p>
Some of my favorite TV shows include Family Guy, Impracticle Jokers, and Game of Thrones. I love tunning into these shows. They are all genuinely good shows that I watch everyday. My favortie movie of all time is Good Will Hunting starring the one and only Matt Damon. MY favorite movie triology is the original Star Wars trilogy. I am in love with Star Wars and simply cant get enough of it. I am so excited for the next star wars to come out in decmember The Last Jedi. For music I music to all kinds of genres but my most listened to would be rap/hip hop. I am very diverse in my music listening to genres suchs as classical music by Frank Sinatra and alternitive rock such as ALt-j and Milky Chance.
